# Open Collaboration Initiative

The Open Collaboration Initiative aims to build better societies.

This repository is currently divided in two folders. The first folder, named "societies", describes what we believe could be better societies. The second, named "path", describes the ways we think we could get there.

PS: As of today, I am alone working on this project. Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss about this subject
